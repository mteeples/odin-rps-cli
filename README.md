## Reflection
It was fun to code a bit in Javascript. I found that it didn't feel too different than my experience in Python. There are naturally some methods that are not available, but I still really enjoyed building the code.

Specifically, the random module in python provides a slightly easier interface for choosing from a list and for generating a random integer, but the JS alternatives weren't too confusing.

I felt proud of my alternative to a long if/else chain. I didn't love my variable name, but that's okay.
